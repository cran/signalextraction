Description: The Direct Filter Approach (DFA) provides efficient estimates of 
	     signals at the current boundary of time series in real-time. For 
             that purpose, one-sided ARMA-filters are computed by minimizing
             customized error criteria. The DFA can be used for estimating  
             either the level or turning-points of a series, knowing that both
             criteria are incongruent. In the context of real-time turning-
             point detection, various risk-profiles can be operationalized, 
             which account for the speed and/or the reliability of the one-
             sided filter.
